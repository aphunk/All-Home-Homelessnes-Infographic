While working as a designer at the Project on Family Homelessness in early 2016, All Home, a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing and ending homelessness in Washington State requested an infographic for that year's One Night Count of homelessness in King County to share a clear narrative about the needs in King County and what our community is doing to help. It became a widely shared education and advocacy tool that is still in use today.
